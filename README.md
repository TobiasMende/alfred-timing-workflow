# Alfred Timing Workflow
**Note:** This is an unofficial workflow. I am a Timing user but do not have any other connections with the app or the company behind it.

## Usage
This workflow is designed to interact with [Timing](https://timingapp.com) for easy time tracking.

## Triggers
- **Keywords:** You can trigger the app via Keyword. Defaults: `tn` as the general entry point to this workflow and `tstart` to start a new timer.
- **Hotkeys:** Use ⌃+⌥+⌘+T to toggle the timer (start if stopped, stop if started).

## Modifiers
When starting a new timer:
- ⌘ – Start instantly, without prompting for an additional title or note.

## Requirements
This workflow needs [Timing](https://timingapp.com) with a license that allows using the Apple Script API.

## Implementation Details
This workflow uses the AppleScript features of Timing: [Full AppleScript Reference for Timing – Timing Time Tracker](https://timingapp.com/help/applescript)
